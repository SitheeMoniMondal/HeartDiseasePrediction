# HeartDiseasePrediction
# Introduction
According to the World Health Organization, every year 12 million deaths occur worldwide due to Heart Disease. The load of cardiovascular disease is rapidly increasing all over the world from the past few years. Many researches have been conducted in attempt to pinpoint the most influential factors of heart disease as well as accurately predict the overall risk. Heart Disease is even highlighted as a silent killer which leads to the deathÂ of the person without obvious symptoms. The early diagnosis of heart disease plays a vital role in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high-risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. This project aims to predict future Heart Disease by analyzing data of patients which classifies whether they have heart disease or not using machine-learning algorithms.
